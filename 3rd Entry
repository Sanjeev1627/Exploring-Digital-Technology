In the next class, we discussed about Linux. We had some prior about Linux from the previous course.
The devices we use like Windows and Mac are open-source operating system. 
Similarly, Linux is also an open-source operating system, which is used for cloud storage, database management system, etc. 
Some features of Linux are: 1) It is an open-souce OS, so it is free and we do not have to pay for it. 
2) It is less prone to viruses. 3) The best part I like about it is that we can make customizations in it and make it in a way that fits our style. 
There are many versions of Linux, the version that we are using now is Ubuntu. 
As a new user of Linux, I found it quite easy to use this version of Linux. 
Some of the basic linux command are: mkdir- creates a new working directory. 
ls- Shows all files and folders. cd- Using this command, we can move to a different folder. 
rm- Deletes files or folders permanently. mv- Can be used to remove or move files.
exit- From the name we can know, it helps in closing the terminal. 
Next we discussed about computers and its part. The five main functional unit in a computer we talked were:
Input unit, Output unit, Memory unit, Arithmetic Logic Unit, and Control Unit.
