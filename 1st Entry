In the first class we were introduced to the course and were told that we have 4 units which are Computers and Software Organization, Intro to Linux, Version Control and Security, and Network Databases and the Web. That class we also talked about the difference between digital and analog and told that we are always focused on the low power technology. We then talked about Address line/bus which helps in locating the information stored. In the next class we learned about logic gates and learned how CPU helps in completing any action. After an action is initiated it is communicated to the CPU, it then communicates it to the Arithmetic Logic Unit, then to Accumulator, and then to Program Counter. We also got to know that Compilers and Interpreters are language translators. Next class we talked about binary system like 1,0. I got to know that in computer language everything works like 1 and 0 and not yes and no. Even if everything is right but just a single 0 or  1 is misplaced the entire action results in error. This  happened in our moddle test when because of a binary error all the A options were marked correct even if they were wrong.
