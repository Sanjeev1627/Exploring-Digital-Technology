Next class, we were introduced to the idea of Binary. It was a new thing for me.
Initially, I thought it to be hard, but as she explained, it was not that tough.
To convert a decimal number to binary, we have to first divide the given number by 2.
Then record the remainder. We have to keep repeating the process with the quotient until it becomes zero. 
To get the binary representation, we have to write the remainders in reverse order. 
After that, we were taught 2's complement. 
What is two's complement? -> "Two's complement is a mathematical operation on binary numbers used to represent signed(positive, negative, or zero) intergers in binary"(built.com)
To find two's complement, we have to first write the positive binary equivalent, with a fixed bit-length(we were told to write 8-bit)
Then we have to reverse all the bits, for example, all 0s to 1s and all 1s to 0s.
The last step is to add 1 to the reversed binary number.
This was very helpful in getting an introduction to binary.
