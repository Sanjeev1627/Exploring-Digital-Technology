We got a group project, and our topic was "How do Credit Card Transactions work?"
We were a group of four, and the decision to choose the topic was ours. We decided it mutually. 
It was very helpful to work as a group in Git, as whenever we found that something more could be added to a particular section, we did that.\
And it did not matter if we were adding something in our section only, but if we found something related to another group member's part during our research, we added it. 
It was a convenient way as we made changes through Git when we could not meet. 
I also understood that to complete work as a group, the contribution of everyone is very important, especially while doing a project related to technology. 
This is because everything is dependent on one another. For example, if I am doing the fraud techniques part, the security measures for it are important. 
Because without that, the research will not be enough. 
Overall, the project helped me in doing a technical project as a group and gave me areas to improve.
