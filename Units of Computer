In the first class, we were introduced to the course and were told that we have 4 units which are Computers and Software Organization, Intro to Linux, Version Control and Security, and Network Databases and the Web. 
In that class, we also talked about the difference between digital and analog and were told that we are always focused on low-power technology. 
We then talked about the address line/bus, which helps locate the information stored. 
In the next class, we learned about logic gates and how a CPU helps in completing any action. 
After an action is initiated, it is communicated to the CPU, which then communicates it to the Arithmetic Logic Unit, then to the Accumulator, and then to the Program Counter.
We also learned that compilers and interpreters are language translators. 
Next class, we talked about the binary system, like 1,0. I got to know that in computer language, everything works like 1 and 0 and not yes and no.
Even if everything is right, just a single 0 or  1 is misplaced, the entire action results in an error. 
This  happened in our moddle test when, because of a binary error, all the A options were marked correct even if they were wrong.
